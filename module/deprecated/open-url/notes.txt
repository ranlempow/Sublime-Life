known domain extensions from: http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt

bugs
	known
		path not opening in MacOS, like /bin
		not detecting 'ends with' if url is in quotes
	fixed
		whitespacing on edges prevent detection of url type
		open_url is evidently a poorly documented but built-in sublime command, so this is overriding some default sublime features like pulling up the Documentation from the help menu
	
improvement ideas
	backlog
		fix open/run of files, like: ~/code/work/manpow/data_analysis/common/nwadb/tables-and-columns.xlsx
		open paths with posix variables
		swap platform environment variables
			on PC: $myvar => %myvar%
			on posix: %myvar% => $myvar
		custom open handlers, like registering a regex with a way to handle it, like 'bug 123' will open in work item tracking system
		scan to see if cursor is inside quotes to a path that exists, "c:\temp\folder w space\file w space.txt" opens		
		look in project for matching file name (relative path not required), needs sublime text 3, http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-beta
		add run with, lets user pick an app to run a file with instead of just the shell
		Open multipe items with a return or carrage return like these:
			http://google.com
			gmail.com
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Cold_Medina
		aliases
			[myfile] somewhere in the file # Open this [myfile] = c:\asdasdasd
	implemented/fixed
		for folders add 'open in new window'
		for files, add 'reveal'
		for folders, add 'reveal'
		for folders add 'add to project'
		add support for ~ in folders
		support all icann top level domain extensions
		bug: open_url is a registered command, need to find another command name
		setting to always run or always edit certain files
			"endswith", ".sublime-project", "run"
			"endswith", ".sln", "run"
			"endswith", ".txt", "edit"
